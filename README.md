# Titanic-Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using a machine learning approach. It is implemented in Python and leverages Google Colab for an interactive and efficient development environment.

## Features
**Data Analysis**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and extract meaningful insights.

**Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for machine learning, including handling missing values, feature encoding, and scaling.

**Model Development**: Build and train machine learning models to predict survival rates, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

**Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Technologies Used
**Programming Language**: Python  
**Development Environment**: Google Colab  
**Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- A Google account for accessing Google Colab.  
- Familiarity with Python and basic machine learning concepts.

## Outcome
This project helps demonstrate proficiency in data analysis, machine learning, and Python programming, providing a hands-on example of solving a classic predictive modeling problem.
